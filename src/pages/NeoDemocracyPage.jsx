            <Paragraph>
            The above pious goal can be achieved in the light of original Indian Constitution which incorporates every element of noble democracy along with its noble directions to achieve scientific socialism. The architects of Indian constitution were so learned, liberal and intelligent as they incorporated best principles of democracy from the constitution of so many marvelous democratic nations i.e. Britain, USA, Canada, Oreland, Germany, Australia. They have prepared such a draft which can be useful to guide us towards the principle of equality, liberty, sovereignty, secularism, federalism, people's fundamental right and judicial independence along with socialism without use of any unjustified force. The original Indian constitution did not mention the concept of party politics. The Constitution also consisted of check and balance of power among the three arms that are - Llegislative, Eexecutive and Judicial systems. Nobody is supreme, yet the most important factor in democracy appears to be will of the people -which vest in the Parliament and Assembly throughout the country. So as per meaning of democracy , the will of people of India being represented in Parliament and state Assemblies which is really supreme but nevertheless it is not Almighty as it is to be checked and balanced by the principles of equality, liberty, secularism, social justice, federalism and peoples fundamental right , all of them being so important principles of democracy, to be interpreted, safeguarded and established by Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Courts so as to avoid encroachment and eroding of democracy.

            <SectionTitle>Original Constitutional Vision vs Current Reality</SectionTitle>
            <Paragraph>
            One of the most important things to be noted is that the architects of our constitution never endorsed so many political parties and didn't even mention the political parties of that time. In fact, Mahatma Gandhi was in favor to abolish Indian National Congress. The reason might have been as Indian National Congress before the independence was a strong movement representing the whole nation. It was not the political party. All the great personality in the history of independence movement of India had been its member and whole country represented this. But with advance of time in post –independent India, Indian National Congress - a glorious-movement liberating the country-became the party, enjoying power for many decades and slowly and slowly, the dirty game of politics for remaining in power all the time- polluted the sacred heart of such glorious movement- Indian National congress. It became weak and gradually, it lost the love, respect and confidence of people of India as people thought that it has departed from its original character of being close to people - at time it applied the political card of divide and rule formulae so the people dissatisfied, the result- it is striving for its existence. Contemporarily, other national and innumerable regional parties took the advantage and became in power but again also in them, the same character of political culture and dominance by leadership is carried forward and even few parties is having their Supremo/CEO as like a head of private limited company merely in the name of their vote banks and their sole existence is based on the same divide and rule formulae of caste, religion, state, language and other factors of diversity. So, the society and masses are dissatisfied and aspire some sort of change in polity which can present nobility, genuinely employ the instrument of Constitution and science in the politics. In fact, the great constitutional makers were foresighted in above respect and hence not mentioned the political parties in the original Indian Constitution Draft and left this job for the coming generations. They never assumed and thought that in future, time might come when the political parties would make mockery of democracy by playing the cards of caste, religion, ethnicity, language, or even using money and tainted people with mafia mindset and criminals etc- no matter how much it harmed and hampered the principle of socialism, secularism, justice, liberty and equality, the very principles of democracy and also the unity, cohesion and integrity of the society and country.

                Only few top persons, being at the helm of party- rules the parties. They say that they have democratic character but in fact but only party Supremo are all in all in deciding candidature of the person as candidates fighting for MLA OR MP. There is no real internal democratic process in the election of candidate from lower to up. And even if -every one of them show such process in existence in their party on paper but in reality, all is by supremo-order and selection. The candidates preferred or selected by party Supremo are imposed to their workers and thus to the people.

            <Paragraph>
            The political parties claim that they are not subject to right to information law as they are not public authority. It is ridiculous that they expend billions of public money when they are in government but not ready at all for being included under RTI law and penal procedures, as they are supreme and they pass the laws in Parliament exempting their own scrutiny and transparency for their affairs. Moreover, most of the political parties choose possible winner candidates on the formulae of combination of equations based on caste, creed, religion, money and even mafia powers with so many possible factors for winning elections which could be unethical, immoral and against the unity and integrity of country. In fact, political parties and most modern politicians see the utility of above factors in political mobilization for their own good and power gain. The various dynamic and ever changing selfish formula of power game are being structured and applied. These formulas lack any substantial ideology and morality. At times this causes tension and violence in society and thereby resultant distortion of our unity in diversity. Actually, they never assume that their consequent results could be detrimental to the public cohesion and Constitution of nation, resulting into a real internal threat to the country. In addition to this, a real social and political worker of their own party in most of the constituencies cannot get a ticket in the electoral process and another person with above mentioned unethical multi- factorial considerations who has not worked even for a single day in his constituency gets the ticket, showing the great fallacies depicting present democracy as of the party, by the party, for the party in place of democracy being of the people, by the people and for the people.

            <SectionTitle>The Neo-Democracy Solution</SectionTitle>
            <Paragraph>
            After considering the above, the need of the hour is that thinkers, philosophers, social and political scientists should think about the system of governance which utilizes the noble and wonderful qualities of Indian Constitution which promotes and direct the peaceful co-existence and non-supremo dominance and refrain politics of divide and rule of people among Indian people for the benefit of humanity. And of course that can be the future best form of government on this planet which can be called as Neo-democracy- a democracy incorporating good features of democracy i.e. civil liberties, equality before law, freedom of expression and speech, peaceful Assembly and freedom to practice respective religions without disturbing social order and mutual sentiments and Neo-Communism--scientific socialism along with careof weaker and poor segment of society. How can the above be achieved?
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
            Our country is Sovereign, Socialistic, Secular, Federal Democratic Republic and this is the soul of our Constitution.
            To obtain the Sovereignty, our democracy must be by the people, of the people and for the people- in place of current scenario of democracy by the party. Here the flow of democracy should metamorphose from down to up in place of from up to down in present system. In present time, all political parties say and claim that they represent the people of the country but reality is something very different. Supremos took every decision, no inner real democracy is maintained even in any parties. All is based on the Supremo real interest for the getting anyhow power. Their all interest is how they becomes heads of government, be CMs or PM. So morally, ethically and even politically, the present multiparty concept should gradually be altered to two party system. In fact, original Constitution draft adopted by Constituent Assembly does not mention the multiparty system. So, this multi-parties system which has emerged in the present form in last 70 years of post-independence era is- a Pseudo-democracy. It is anti-Constitutional and against the principle of Democracy itself.

                <Paragraph>
                In the present system, First Pass The Post (FPTP System) is applied in our country. In this system, the first candidates is elected even though he never gets (majority) more than 50% of polled vote. Rather he gets 30-40% of polled vote or 20-25 of the all vote.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                In Present System (FPTP), only minority mandate goes to parliament. Therefore- how it can be said as Democracy which is the soul and base of our noble Constitution.

                <Paragraph>
                So- in place of FPTP system, we propose Two Pass The Post system (TPTP). Here first and second ranker is elected --first repreent Ruling party (पक्ष Paksh-) and second (Pratipaksh प्रतिपक्ष -) Balancing party. So, we should replace FPTP (first pass the post) to TPTP (two pass the post) system. The total of both will be more than 50 percent-will fulfil criteria of democracy.

            <Paragraph>
                "So- for applying this model to uplift and make country very strong- we- the people, the people of India -should elect two candidates (TPTP) in place of one (FPTP)- that is- first and second ranker in each constituency and send them to Parliament/State Assemblies. First one-winner- should represent ruling party and second one -runner- the opposition party". We understand that India consist of Parliamentary constituency/ state Assemblies which is mini-India as ealiar described. Thus- people in each constituency have right to have ruling and opposition – as PAKCHHA पक्ष and PRATI PAKCHHA प्रतिपक्ष- same like Parliament or State Assemblies. So, people- should elect winner and runner ups, representing the majority -more than 50% of polled votes- as ruling winner up PAKCHHA and 2nd ranker as runner ups PRATI PAKCHHA party respectively- at national and state level.
            </Paragraph>
            </CallToAction>

            <FinalThought>
            <Paragraph>
                Thus, from the whole nation -all winner ups should collectively represent the PAKCHHA पक्ष and the runner ups represent the PRATI -PAKCHHA प्रतिपक्ष in Parliament. Ruling and opposition-- party members irrespective of original party line- from all over the India should elect their leader as Prime minister and leader of opposition respectively under the strict supervision and guidance of present Constitutional body – Election commission of India UNDER THE GUIDELINES AND SUGGESTION OF SUPREME COURT OF INDIA. Prime minister – thus elected should choose councils of ministers on merit and on Constitutional provisions of social, religious, regional balances and their performance in their life along with reservation norms -enshrined in Constitution of India to avoid social misunderstanding and conflict.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                In this System, although all parties can fight in election process but after winning or losing, they will be regarded as one among two-either in Ruling First ranker PAKS-पक्ष H -party or if runner प्रतिपक्ष ,will go to opposing party irrespective of their conventional original party line. So, this system will be rejecting the concept of present multiparty politics where parties represent and work more for party in place common people who not voted them and blackmail each other. The present existing System does not represent majority of the people and blackmailing business is non-ending process in power game, many times against national interest and enjoy many concessions through corruptions in power game. At the time of election, the whole national scene is overwhelmed by blame game of political parties polluting National Spirit and dividing the people of India.
